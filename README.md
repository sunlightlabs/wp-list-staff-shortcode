# wp-list-staff-shortcode
Wordpress plugin to show staff on new Sunlight site.

This adds two new shortcodes:

`[stafflist group="name"]`

Will show all staff members in the given group (e.g. `staff` or `cofounders`).

`[sfrex]`

Will pick a member of the `staff` group based on the current day. For use with Rex the Cleanosaur.
